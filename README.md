# Kata's

To start solving a kata, navigate to the src/main/java/org/kata directory, where you will find a folder named after you.

Inside your learner directory, you'll find the kata files assigned to you. Begin by working on these kata challenges to develop your understanding of Java and ability to solve problems with Java. 

The corresponding test cases for each kata are located in the src/test/java/org/kata folder, under your learner directory. 

Use these test files to verify that your solution works as expected, running the tests regularly will ensure your code meets the requirements.
