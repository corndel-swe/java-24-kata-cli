     * Finds the largest prime number less than or equal to a given integer.
     * <p>
     * The function takes an integer input and returns the largest prime number that is less than or equal
     * to the specified integer. If the input integer is less than 2, the function will return -1, as there
     * are no prime numbers below 2. If the input integer itself is prime, the function will return that
     * integer. The implementation efficiently checks each number starting from the given integer and works
     * downwards, stopping at the first prime number it encounters.
     * <p>
     * A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying
     * two smaller natural numbers. This means that a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors:
     * 1 and itself.
